Oppia is an open-source project whose aim is to empower learners across the globe by providing access to high-quality, engaging education. We envision a society in which access to high-quality education is a human right rather than a privilege.

The web version of Oppia currently provides a growing curated set of lessons on Basic Mathematics, together with tools for creating them and augmenting them with translations and voiceovers to support learners who don‚Äôt speak English and learners who are less proficient at reading. Visit [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org/learn/math) to access these lessons.

Oppia Web is written using Python, Typescript, and Angular.

## üì± [Oppia Android](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android) | [<img height="30" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Have%20a%20question%3F%20Ask%20the%20team%21-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white" />][GitHub_Discussion_Android]

The Android app is a new, not-yet-released frontend for Oppia that provides access to Oppia's curated numeracy lessons for users who may not have regular access to internet connectivity, and in a way that can be easily shared across multiple members of the same household. All the Basic Mathematics lessons present in Oppia Web will also be accessible via Oppia Android, which will allow users to download lessons and play them offline later.

Oppia Android is written using Kotlin and Java, and it leverages Bazel, databinding, Dagger 2, and AndroidX.
